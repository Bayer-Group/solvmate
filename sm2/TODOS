- Set up a dataset that will be able to load
  in molecular pairs (mol1,mol2). For this
  we will have to adapt ugly the dataloader code...

- There will be two Networks: 
  * An Encoder NN that will encode
    molecular graphs into vectors.
  * An Interaction NN that will reduce all
    information (solute,solvent-1,solvent-2,Temperature)
    into a final solubility prediction...

  BUT:
  ----
  We will have a pair, so therefore we will have two of them:

	A: solute, solvent-1, solvent-2, T
		vs. 
	B: solute, solvent-1, solvent-2, T

 Idea:
 -----
 Subtract the embeddings. Because we are having NN embeddings,
 the subtraction should not lead to the same loss of information
 as we had it with the ET.
